# Sudoku-Validation-with-Multithreading
A Sudoku puzzle uses a 9 × 9 grid in which each column and row, as well as each of the nine 3 × 3 sub grids, must contain all of the digits 1 ··· 9. 
This code consists of designing a multithreaded application that determines whether the Sudoku puzzle is valid or not.
